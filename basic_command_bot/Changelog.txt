# January 21, 2024

## Command Structuring and Parsing:

- Implemented parsing of complex command inputs (e.g., `/command String Int`). Better to pipe to String and then let the command handle it directly.

## Database Enhancements:

- Added functions to check for an active season, season details, start a new season, and stop the current season.

## Error Handling Improvements:

- Addressed various error handling issues, particularly related to database connections and command execution.
- Improved error messages for better debugging and user feedback.

## File Reading for Changelog:

- Created functionality to read from a `changelog.txt` file and send its contents as a message in Telegram.
